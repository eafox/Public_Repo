# Random and Gradient Forests

#### Background
Random and gradient forests are a system of decision trees. This method is useful as an alternative to a glm for parsing the effect of multiple parameters on a response variable.  
This folder includes examples for the following packages:  
* [tree](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tree/index.html)
