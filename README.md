# Public Repository for Emma Fox

#### Welcome!

I am a Data scientist with 3 years of industry experience and 2 years of academic experience in Python, R, and shell scripting. I have a background in biology and ecology, specifically working with genetic data and training other scientists in related analytical methods.  

Many of the projects I have contributed to involve data that is in the process of being published. So, I created this repository as a way to showcase my work and make some of my tutorials public without releasing any data prematurely. 

## Directory
* Master's Thesis Work  
_Imperial College London (Oct 2016-Sept 2017)_  

__An exploration of linkage disequilibrium measurement and interpretation of decay using next generation sequencing data__  

My focus as a master's student was testing a new method for calculating linkage disequilibrium. This involved simulating data to quantify the method's improvement in accuracy, applying the new method to multiple real data sets, and contributing scripts to the package that applied this new method.  

This directory contains some of the scripts I used during this process as well as a more in depth explanation of what my work involved.  

Additional Work:

[Repository for Package Tutorial](https://github.com/EFox16/ngsLD-Tutorial)  

* Graduate Student Researcher Work  
_University of California, Los Angeles (Sept 2017-April 2018)_  

I spent several months after my master's program as a PhD student and graduate student researcher at UCLA (though I ultimately decided to not pursue a PhD at that time). My work here involved contributing to analysis the [CALeDNA](http://www.ucedna.com/) team was performing. I learned random forest and network analysis techniques from collaborators outside the lab. I then constructed a repository containing scripts for team members to use on new data and to teach them to apply these techniques independently.  

This directory contains a copy of the repository I created for the team with modifications to keep the data private.
